# Data-Driven-Academic-Performance-Analysis-System
This project automates the analysis of student exam performance using Excel, Python, and Power BI. It processes student data entered into structured Excel sheets, calculates topic-wise, unit-wise, and subject-wise performance, and generates detailed reports. Class-wide performance is visualized using Power BI dashboards.
